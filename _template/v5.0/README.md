# HackerRank Template Generator v5.0

## Changes from v4.0
1. [ ] Removal of verification cases
 The verifications folder has been removed, to emphasise the need for a proof-of-concept code using the cases in `test_cases`.

1. [x] Sample cases
 Sample cases will be directly downloaded from HackerRank, with the download stored in RAM to avoid writing to memory.  

1. [ ] Difficulty level
 Challenges will be automatically added to their relevant difficulty folders.
