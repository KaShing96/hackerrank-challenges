# Solution
This reads a lot like a math problem. 
1. The first condition requests for a lowest common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in the first array. 
2. The second condition requests for a highest common factor (HCF) of all numbers in the second array.

Thus, we obtain the LCM of all numbers in the first array *first*.
